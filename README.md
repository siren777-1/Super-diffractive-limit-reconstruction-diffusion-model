# Super-diffractive-limit-reconstruction-diffusion-model
---

## 📘 Overview

This project proposes a hybrid Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) that surpasses the diffraction limit for sub-diffraction target recovery.  
The model integrates spatial and channel attention mechanisms, including **SCAU** and **SGFE** , to recover high-frequency details that conventional methods fail to reconstruct.
